"""Parakh AI — Enforcement support module.

Implements two enforcement artefacts demanded by DoCA workflows:

1. Penalty estimation under the Legal Metrology Act, 2009:
   - Section 36 : punishment for contravention of provisions
       1st offence  -> fine up to INR 25,000 (+ imprisonment up to 1 yr)
       subsequent   -> fine up to INR 50,000 (+ imprisonment 6 mo - 2 yrs)
   - Section 38 : penalty for non-registration / other specified offences

2. Show-Cause Notice generation — statutory notice template addressed to the
   manufacturer/packer/importer quoting detected violations + clauses.

NOTE: Estimates are advisory (for enforcement officer use) and clearly
labelled as such; final sanction order remains with the legal authority.
